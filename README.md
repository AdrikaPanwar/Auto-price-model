# Auto-price-model

## This is a model to perform price prediction of the automobiles with the help of Azure and ML Studio

### (This the link of my prediction model which I have done with the real-time predictions)

#### How I go through it, here is the step by step guide and I am leaving the png of my project too, so that you can understand it;  

1.  Click on the 3 icon in the azure portal and then move on to the resource group and after that click on the create (to create the resource group)
2.  then open the azure ML studio and click on the workspace ( here is your resource group)
3.  then click on the designer to create the graph by using the drag and drop to create the pipelines
4.  create the pipelines with the help of sample data or you can download the data manually from the search engine related to weather, automobile , heart diseases etc on which you want to perform the model
5.  then click on the pipeline to perform filters etc and after that deploy it by seeing the visualizations if it worked or not

### (In one png, I have done Data Wrangler it is a tool in the microsoft fabric where you can get the summary and visually analysis of your data in the stastical format)


#### I am using the Azure-free subscription to explore it and making this model too but unable to directly upload it (deploy) here because of the cost , so you can understand my concern easily; that's why I am uploading the png of my project and it is the nice experience as a student to explore the Data wrangler, regression, MLflow, hyperparameter and retrain model in the free-subscription too.

##### You should explore and give it a try to perform it because hand on experience is the true knowledge :)
